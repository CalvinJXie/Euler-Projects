# Project Euler
My solution code to project euler questions at https://projecteuler.net/problem. This is to improve my coding/logistical skills.

## Setup
1. To run the code, download a GNU copiler
2. open a command prompt and navigate to the directory. In this case it is ```cd Euler-Projects/completed/problem_x```
3. type ```g++ -Wextra -Wall -pedantic -pedantic-errors -o a problem.cpp``` into the command prompt. The "a" is the executable file name, "problem.cpp" is the file name.
4. then type ```./a``` or ```a``` or the executable prompt requirement. This executes your main function.
